# ðŸŒŠ 42 Piscine Overview

Welcome to my 42 Piscine journey at 42 Wolfsburg which took part February 2022! ðŸš€ 

This intensive, month-long coding bootcamp immersed me in the world of C programming and offered a unique peer-to-peer learning model. I tackled challenging projects that enhanced my skills in problem-solving and debugging, while collaborating with fellow coders to overcome obstacles together.
