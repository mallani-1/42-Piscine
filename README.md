# ðŸŒŠ 42 Piscine Overview

Welcome to my 42 Piscine journey at 42 Wolfsburg in February 2022! ðŸš€

The Piscine is an inclusive, month-long coding bootcamp open to everyone, regardless of prior programming experience. I entered with limited coding background and quickly dove into the rigorous world of C programming. This intensive experience, centered around a unique peer-to-peer learning model, involved collaborative problem-solving and tackling challenging projects, greatly sharpening my debugging and development skills.

I'm excited to share that my commitment and growth during the Piscine led to my selection for the full 42 curriculum!
